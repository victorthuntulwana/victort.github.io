            Hey folks!, Victor Thuntulwana here,  a Java trainee programmer who is a former bank service consultant who has a finance and economics degree and has interests in data/business and financial analysis. Been on the Capitec Bank rollercoaster since 2016, making sure my work doesn't just meet standardsâ€”it high-fives them! I'm not just a coding machine;I'm also that guy who brings a little sunshine to team collaborations.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now, onto the serious stuff. While I'm knee-deep in coding adventures, my endgame is anything but typical. I'm on a mission to equip rural kids with the coding skills I'm mastering. Because who said coding can't change the world and sprinkle a little fun along the way?
            </p>
            <p>
            One of my core interests lies in making rural areas centres for maths and stats, innovation and tech & domain knowledge, then the world would be a better place. 
            </p>
